        "# Spell-Checking\n",
        "\n",
        "A text auto-correction and spell checker tool using language models is a software application that automatically detects and corrects spelling and grammatical errors in text based on a given language model. This tool is valuable for improving the quality and readability of written content, whether it's in documents, emails, chat messages, or any other form of text-based communication.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how such a tool typically works:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Input Text: The tool takes an input text string as its primary input. This text can be of any length and can contain one or more sentences or paragraphs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Tokenization: The input text is tokenized into individual words or tokens. Tokenization is the process of splitting a text into meaningful units, such as words or punctuation marks.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Spell Checking: The tool uses a language model and a dictionary of known words to identify misspelled words in the text. It checks each token against the dictionary and marks any words that do not exist in the dictionary as potentially misspelled.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Grammar Checking (Optional): In addition to spell checking, some advanced tools also perform grammar checking. They analyze the text for grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, and sentence structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Suggestions and Corrections: For each misspelled or grammatically incorrect word, the tool provides a list of suggested corrections based on the language model's knowledge. It suggests alternative words or phrases that might fit the context better.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Correction Process: The user can review the suggestions and choose the most appropriate correction for each error. The tool then replaces the erroneous word or phrase with the selected correction.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Output: The tool generates an output text that includes all the corrections made. The corrected text is now free from spelling and grammar errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Additional Features: Some advanced tools may offer additional features such as autocorrect, which automatically applies corrections without user intervention, and context-aware suggestions that take surrounding words into account for more accurate corrections.\n",
        "\n",
        "- User Interface: Depending on the tool's implementation, it may have a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can interact with the text, review suggestions, and make corrections. Alternatively, it can be a command-line tool or integrated into other applications like word processors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Applications of Text Auto-Correction and Spell Checker Tools:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Word Processing Software: These tools are commonly integrated into word processors like Microsoft Word and Google Docs to assist users in creating error-free documents.\n",
        "- Email Clients: Email clients often include spell checkers to ensure that email messages are well-written and free from errors.\n",
        "- Web Browsers: Some web browsers offer built-in spell checkers that can be enabled to check text entered into online forms and text fields.\n",
        "- Text Messaging Apps: Mobile devices and messaging apps often have autocorrect and spell checking features to help users send accurate and clear messages.\n",
        "- Content Management Systems (CMS): CMS platforms use spell checkers to ensure that website content is error-free and professional.\n",
        "- Language Learning Apps: Language learning apps use spell checkers and grammar checkers to help learners improve their writing skills.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, text auto-correction and spell checker tools using language models play a crucial role in enhancing written communication by minimizing spelling and grammatical errors, ultimately leading to clearer and more professional text.\n",
        "\n",
        "Creating a complete code for a text auto-correction and spell checker tool using language models can be a complex task.but I provide  a **simplified Python code example** using the Python library **pyspellchecker**. This library utilizes pre-built dictionaries for spell-checking.\n",
        "\n",
        "This code defines a correct_text function that takes input text, identifies misspelled words using the **pyspellchecker library**, corrects them, and returns the corrected text along with a list of misspelled words.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you run this code, it will output the original text, the corrected text, and a list of misspelled words.\n",
        "\n",
        "Please note that this is a simplified example, and in a real-world application, you may want to consider more advanced language models for more accurate spell and grammar checking.Additionally, you can expand this tool to handle grammar errors and context-based corrections for more advanced text auto-correction."
