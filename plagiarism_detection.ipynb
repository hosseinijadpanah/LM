        "# Simple Plagiarism Checker Using Language Models\n",
        "\n",
        "Creating a **comprehensive plagiarism checker** with advanced techniques, including handling multiple documents, detecting paraphrasing, and incorporating a larger corpus of reference texts, is a complex task that goes beyond the scope of a simple code example. Such systems typically involve sophisticated natural language processing, machine learning, and text similarity algorithms.\n",
        "high-level overview of the steps and components involved in building a more advanced plagiarism checker:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Data Collection:\n",
        "\n",
        "Gather a large corpus of reference texts, such as academic papers, articles, and documents. This corpus will be used for comparison.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Text Preprocessing:\n",
        "Preprocess both the input text (the document to be checked for plagiarism) and the reference texts. This includes tokenization, stemming, and removing stop words.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Text Embeddings:\n",
        "\n",
        "Convert the preprocessed texts into dense vector representations (embeddings). Techniques like **Word2Vec, GloVe, or more advanced ones like BERT** embeddings can be used.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Similarity Calculation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Compute the similarity between the input text and each reference text using cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, or more advanced algorithms like Siamese neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Threshold Setting:\n",
        "\n",
        "Define a threshold similarity score below which a document is considered plagiarized. This threshold depends on your specific requirements and can be determined through experimentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Paraphrasing Detection:\n",
        "\n",
        "Implement paraphrasing detection by comparing not only exact matches but also semantically similar phrases or sentences within the text. This can involve techniques like semantic similarity analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Handling Multiple Documents:\n",
        "\n",
        "Extend the system to handle multiple documents simultaneously. You can compare the input document against a set of reference documents and determine the degree of plagiarism across all documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "- User Interface:\n",
        "\n",
        "Develop a user-friendly interface for users to input their documents and view plagiarism reports.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Scalability:\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider the scalability of your system, especially when dealing with a large corpus of reference texts. Efficient data structures and indexing mechanisms can help speed up the process.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Testing and Evaluation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Evaluate the plagiarism checker using a diverse set of test cases and real-world data to ensure its accuracy and reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Creating a complete plagiarism checker with all these features requires a significant amount of development and resources. It often involves using machine learning models, extensive training data, and potentially cloud computing resources for large-scale applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " I'll provide you with a simplified example that uses cosine similarity to compare text documents. Please note that this is a basic demonstration and may not be as sophisticated as dedicated plagiarism detection tools.\n",
